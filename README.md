## Files

* "kaise1.txt" contains the current translation.
* "lyrics.pdf" contains the original lyrics, but is not in source control out of respect for the original artists.

## Conventions

Each line is followed by a tab and a gloss in parentheses.
If the number of syllables in a line is off from my target, that is denoted by the offset within brackets.
